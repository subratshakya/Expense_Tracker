### Release Integrity

The GitHub release contains a detached signature file for the NPM package (named
`mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig`).

The following command returns the link npm package.
```shell
npm view mongodb@vX.Y.Z dist.tarball
```

Using the result of the above command, a `curl` command can return the official npm package for the release.

To verify the integrity of the downloaded package, run the following command:
```shell
gpg --verify mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

#### Typescript Version

<<<<<<< HEAD
We recommend using the latest version of typescript, however we currently ensure the driver's public types compile against `typescript@4.1.6`.
This is the lowest typescript version guaranteed to work with our driver: older versions may or may not work - use at your own risk.
Since typescript [does not restrict breaking changes to major versions](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Breaking-Changes) we consider this support best effort.
If you run into any unexpected compiler failures against our supported TypeScript versions please let us know by filing an issue on our [JIRA](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE).

## Installation

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js 5.x driver is by using the `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

After you've created your own project using `npm init`, you can run:

```bash
npm install mongodb
# or ...
yarn add mongodb

Please do not email any of the driver developers directly with issues or questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the [MongoDB Community Forums](https://community.mongodb.com/tags/c/drivers-odms-connectors/7/node-js-driver).

### Change Log

Change history can be found in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md).

### Compatibility

For version compatibility matrices, please refer to the following links:

- [NodeJS](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/#reference-compatibility-language-node)

## Installation

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js driver is by using `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

## MongoDB Driver

Given that you have created your own project using `npm init` we install the MongoDB driver and its dependencies by executing the following `npm` command.

```bash
npm install mongodb --save
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
```

This will download the MongoDB driver and add a dependency entry in your `package.json` file.

If you are a Typescript user, you will need the Node.js type definitions to use the driver's definitions:

```sh
npm install -D @types/node
```

## Driver Extensions

The MongoDB driver can optionally be enhanced by the following feature packages:

Maintained by MongoDB:

- Zstd network compression - [@mongodb-js/zstd](https://github.com/mongodb-js/zstd)
- MongoDB field level and queryable encryption - [mongodb-client-encryption](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt#readme)
- GSSAPI / SSPI / Kerberos authentication - [kerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos)

Some of these packages include native C++ extensions.
Consult the [trouble shooting guide here](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/HEAD/etc/notes/native-extensions.md) if you run into compilation issues.

Third party:

- Snappy network compression - [snappy](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/snappy)
- AWS authentication - [@aws-sdk/credential-providers](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/packages/credential-providers)

## Quick Start

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple CRUD operations. For more in-depth coverage, see the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/).
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
You can also use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en) package manager.

## Troubleshooting

The MongoDB driver depends on several other packages. These are:

- [bson](https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson)
- [bson-ext](https://github.com/mongodb-js/bson-ext)
- [kerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos)
- [mongodb-client-encryption](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt#readme)

The `kerberos` package is a C++ extension that requires a build environment to be installed on your system. You must be able to build Node.js itself in order to compile and install the `kerberos` module. Furthermore, the `kerberos` module requires the MIT Kerberos package to correctly compile on UNIX operating systems. Consult your UNIX operation system package manager for what libraries to install.

**Windows already contains the SSPI API used for Kerberos authentication. However, you will need to install a full compiler tool chain using Visual Studio C++ to correctly install the Kerberos extension.**

### Diagnosing on UNIX

If you don’t have the build-essentials, this module won’t build. In the case of Linux, you will need gcc, g++, Node.js with all the headers and Python. The easiest way to figure out what’s missing is by trying to build the Kerberos project. You can do this by performing the following steps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos
cd kerberos
npm install
```

If all the steps complete, you have the right toolchain installed. If you get the error "node-gyp not found," you need to install `node-gyp` globally:

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

If it correctly compiles and runs the tests you are golden. We can now try to install the `mongod` driver by performing the following command.

```bash
cd yourproject
npm install mongodb --save
```

If it still fails the next step is to examine the npm log. Rerun the command but in this case in verbose mode.

```bash
npm --loglevel verbose install mongodb
```

This will print out all the steps npm is performing while trying to install the module.

### Diagnosing on Windows

A compiler tool chain known to work for compiling `kerberos` on Windows is the following.

- Visual Studio C++ 2010 (do not use higher versions)
- Windows 7 64bit SDK
- Python 2.7 or higher

Open the Visual Studio command prompt. Ensure `node.exe` is in your path and install `node-gyp`.

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

Next, you will have to build the project manually to test it. Clone the repo, install dependencies and rebuild:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git
cd kerberos
npm install
node-gyp rebuild
```

This should rebuild the driver successfully if you have everything set up correctly.

### Other possible issues

Your Python installation might be hosed making gyp break. Test your deployment environment first by trying to build Node.js itself on the server in question, as this should unearth any issues with broken packages (and there are a lot of broken packages out there).

Another tip is to ensure your user has write permission to wherever the Node.js modules are being installed.

## Quick Start

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js and MongoDB. Its scope is only how to set up the driver and perform the simple CRUD operations. For more in-depth coverage, see the [tutorials](docs/reference/content/tutorials/main.md).

=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697

### Create the `package.json` file

First, create a directory where your application will live.

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
=======
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
```

Enter the following command and answer the questions to create the initial structure for your new project:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
npm init -y
```

Next, install the driver as a dependency.

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

### Start a MongoDB Server

For complete MongoDB installation instructions, see [the manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
npm init
```

Next, install the driver dependency.

```bash
npm install mongodb --save
```

You should see **NPM** download a lot of files. Once it's done you'll find all the downloaded packages under the **node_modules** directory.

### Start a MongoDB Server

For complete MongoDB installation instructions, see [the manual](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697

1. Download the right MongoDB version from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
2. Create a database directory (in this case under **/data**).
3. Install and start a `mongod` process.

```bash
mongod --dbpath=/data
```

You should see the **mongod** process start up and print some status information.

### Connect to MongoDB

Create a new **app.js** file and add the following code to try out some basic CRUD
operations using the MongoDB driver.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
// or as an es module:
// import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client = new MongoClient(url);

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myProject';

async function main() {
  // Use connect method to connect to the server
  await client.connect();
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');
  const db = client.db(dbName);
  const collection = db.collection('documents');

  // the following code examples can be pasted here...

  return 'done.';
}

main()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => client.close());
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Add code to connect to the server and the database **myproject**:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';
const client = new MongoClient(url);
// Use connect method to connect to the server
client.connect(function(err) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  client.close();
});
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
```

Run your app from the command line with:

```bash
node app.js
```

The application should print **Connected successfully to server** to the console.

### Insert a Document

Add to **app.js** the following function which uses the **insertMany**
method to add three documents to the **documents** collection.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
const insertResult = await collection.insertMany([{ a: 1 }, { a: 2 }, { a: 3 }]);
console.log('Inserted documents =>', insertResult);
```

The **insertMany** command returns an object with information about the insert operations.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
const insertDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Insert some documents
  collection.insertMany([{ a: 1 }, { a: 2 }, { a: 3 }], function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(3, result.result.n);
    assert.equal(3, result.ops.length);
    console.log('Inserted 3 documents into the collection');
    callback(result);
  });
};
```

The **insert** command returns an object with the following fields:

- **result** Contains the result document from MongoDB
- **ops** Contains the documents inserted with added **\_id** fields
- **connection** Contains the connection used to perform the insert

Add the following code to call the **insertDocuments** function:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    client.close();
  });
});
```

Run the updated **app.js** file:

```bash
node app.js
```

The operation returns the following output:

```bash
Connected successfully to server
Inserted 3 documents into the collection
```
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697

### Find All Documents

Add a query that returns all the documents.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
const findResult = await collection.find({}).toArray();
console.log('Found documents =>', findResult);
```

This query returns all the documents in the **documents** collection.
<<<<<<< HEAD
If you add this below the insertMany example you'll see the document's you've inserted.
=======
const findDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Find some documents
  collection.find({}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    console.log('Found the following records');
    console.log(docs);
    callback(docs);
  });
};
```

This query returns all the documents in the **documents** collection. Add the **findDocument** method to the **MongoClient.connect** callback:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected correctly to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    findDocuments(db, function() {
      client.close();

### Find Documents with a Query Filter

Add a query filter to find only documents which meet the query criteria.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
const filteredDocs = await collection.find({ a: 3 }).toArray();
console.log('Found documents filtered by { a: 3 } =>', filteredDocs);
=======
const findDocuments = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Find some documents
  collection.find({ a: 3 }).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    console.log('Found the following records');
    console.log(docs);
    callback(docs);
  });
};
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
const filteredDocs = await collection.find({ a: 3 }).toArray();
console.log('Found documents filtered by { a: 3 } =>', filteredDocs);
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
```

Only the documents which match `'a' : 3` should be returned.

### Update a document

The following operation updates a document in the **documents** collection.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
const updateResult = await collection.updateOne({ a: 3 }, { $set: { b: 1 } });
console.log('Updated documents =>', updateResult);
```

The method updates the first document where the field **a** is equal to **3** by adding a new field **b** to the document set to **1**. `updateResult` contains information about whether there was a matching document to update or not.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
const updateDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Update document where a is 2, set b equal to 1
  collection.updateOne({ a: 2 }, { $set: { b: 1 } }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log('Updated the document with the field a equal to 2');
    callback(result);
  });
};
```

The method updates the first document where the field **a** is equal to **2** by adding a new field **b** to the document set to **1**. Next, update the callback function from **MongoClient.connect** to include the update method.

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      client.close();
    });
  });
});
```
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697

### Remove a document

Remove the document where the field **a** is equal to **3**.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
const deleteResult = await collection.deleteMany({ a: 3 });
console.log('Deleted documents =>', deleteResult);
=======
const removeDocument = function(db, callback) {
  // Get the documents collection
  const collection = db.collection('documents');
  // Delete document where a is 3
  collection.deleteOne({ a: 3 }, function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(err, null);
    assert.equal(1, result.result.n);
    console.log('Removed the document with the field a equal to 3');
    callback(result);
  });
};
```

Add the new method to the **MongoClient.connect** callback function.

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

// Database Name
const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    updateDocument(db, function() {
      removeDocument(db, function() {
        client.close();
      });
    });
  });
});
>>>>>>> d9b5d8d4d7e7782577668ed9860ec566a14c8070
=======
const deleteResult = await collection.deleteMany({ a: 3 });
console.log('Deleted documents =>', deleteResult);
>>>>>>> 612faa9106d3f31c019c81e2e601cf7d17c60697
```

performance. The following function creates an index on the **a** field in the
**documents** collection.

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD

console.log('index name =', indexName);
```

## Error Handling

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you need to filter certain errors from our driver we have a helpful tree of errors described in [etc/notes/errors.md](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/HEAD/etc/notes/errors.md).

It is our recommendation to use `instanceof` checks on errors and to avoid relying on parsing `error.message` and `error.name` strings in your code.
We guarantee `instanceof` checks will pass according to semver guidelines, but errors may be sub-classed or their messages may change at any time, even patch releases, as we see fit to increase the helpfulness of the errors.

Any new errors we add to the driver will directly extend an existing error class and no existing error will be moved to a different parent class outside of a major release.
This means `instanceof` will always be able to accurately capture the errors that our driver throws.

```typescript
const client = new MongoClient(url);
await client.connect();
const collection = client.db().collection('collection');

try {
  await collection.insertOne({ _id: 1 });
  await collection.insertOne({ _id: 1 }); // duplicate key error
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof MongoServerError) {
    console.log(`Error worth logging: ${error}`); // special case for some reason
  }
  throw error; // still want to crash
}
```

## Nightly releases

const indexCollection = function(db, callback) {
  db.collection('documents').createIndex({ a: 1 }, null, function(err, results) {
    console.log(results);
    callback();
  });
};
```

Add the `indexCollection` method to your app:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert = require('assert');

// Connection URL
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

const dbName = 'myproject';

// Use connect method to connect to the server
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  insertDocuments(db, function() {
    indexCollection(db, function() {
      client.close();
    });
  });
});
```
